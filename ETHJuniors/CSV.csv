Developed strategy for data science projects and team expansion. Performed EDA on top of production and performance data. Built machine learning models and neural networks to predict yields, classify batches, optimize KPIs, perform root cause analysis, forecast sales demand, identify erroneous transactions. Used black-box explanation methods to interpret and present modeling results to key stakeholders and SMEs. Reference person in Zurich for PowerBI/Qlik dashboard development and deployment.",Neural rap lyrics generation with rhyme density biased sampling,Master Thesis,5.5,"Collaboration with Musixmatch and their Machine Learning team based in Bologna, Italy. Fine-tuned the GPT2 language model network released by OpenAI on a rap lyrics dataset provided by Musixmatch. Proposed a novel inference mode sampling strategy which biases next word probabilities to improve rhyme density on the generated lyrics. Medium article: https://blog.musixmatch.com/generating-rap-lyrics-with-ai-13fb8d33ab5e",Summary refinement through Denoising,Project,6,"We propose a simple method for postprocessing the outputs of a text summarization system in order to refine its overall quality. Our approach is to train text-to-text rewriting models to correct information redundancy errors that may arise during summarization. We train on synthetically generated noisy summaries, testing three different types of noise that introduce out-of-context information within each summary.",Video-to-Video Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks,Project,5.5,"Worked for the Computer Vision and Geometry Group at ETH under Zhaopeng Cui's supervision. Used the latest cycle-consistent adversarial networks for video-to-video translation with focus on day to night conversion. Added an extra flow network to a CycleGAN and improved baseline performance both quantitatively and qualitatively: less flickering artifacts and better frames transitions. Tools: Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, FlowNet2",BURSDET: social network hate monitoring system,Bachelor Thesis,6,"Backend and Frontend development of a platform to monitor hate bursts on data collected from social media using Time Series analysis and the Kleinberg algorithm.
